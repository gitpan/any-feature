This is the Perl distribution any-feature. It can be used like Perl 5.10's
'feature' pragma and will try to "do the right thing", regardless of whether
you use Perl 5.8 or Perl 5.10.


INSTALLATION

any-feature installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

    % cpan any::feature

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

DOCUMENTATION

any-feature documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc any::feature

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
